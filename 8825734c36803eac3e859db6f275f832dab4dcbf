      "message": "Now that we merged the two plugins into one, we need to reconsider the configuration. For the configuration options descried below it is not clear for which LFS backend they apply. For example:\n\n  [plugin \"lfs\"]\n    directory \u003d /some/directory\n    expiration \u003d 10s\n\nHere it is not immediately clear that the first option applies to the FS backed and the second one to the S3 backend.\n\nHow about plugin specific config file etc/lfs.config\n\n  [fs]\n    directory \u003d /some/diretory\n\n  [s3]\n    expiration \u003d 10s",

      "message": "\u003e Here it is not immediately clear that the first option applies to the FS backed and the second one to the S3 backend.\n\nTrue, but it\u0027s not actually possible to enable both at the same time anyway, so it\u0027s not really an issue.\n\nAnd this documentation separates the settings into FS and S3 and mentions that those settings are only used for those backends respectively.  See lines 16 and 26.\n\nNote that the existing FS and S3 plugins handle settings differently.  S3 uses gerrit.config while FS uses its own config (actually this was only recently added).  In this change I\u0027ve taken the S3 approach.",
