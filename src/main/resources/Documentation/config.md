The following configuration options are only used when the backend is `fs`.

fs.directory
: The directory in which to store data files. If not specified, defaults to
the plugin's data folder: `$GERRIT_SITE/data/@PLUGIN@`.

**Amazon S3 configuration**

#### Section `s3`

The following configuration options are only used when the backend is `s3`.

s3.region
: link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions
[Amazon region] the S3 storage bucket is residing in.

s3.bucket
: Name of the link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/UG/CreatingaBucket.html
[Amazon S3 storage bucket] which will store large objects.

s3.storageClass
: link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html
[Amazon S3 storage class] used for storing large objects.
: Default is `REDUCED_REDUNDANCY`

s3.expiration
: Expiration in seconds of validity of signed requests. Gerrit's LFS protocol
handler signs requests to be issued by the git-lfs extension with the configured
`accessKey` and `secretKey`. This way the git-lfs extension doesn't need
any credentials to access objects in the S3 bucket. Validity of these request
signatures expires after this period.

: `true`: SSL verification is disabled
: `false`: SSL verification is enabled
: Default is `false`.

s3.accessKey

[Amazon IAM accessKey] for authenticating to S3. It is recommended to place this
setting in `$GERRIT_SITE/etc/@PLUGIN@.secure.config`.

s3.secretKey
: The link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html
[Amazon IAM secretKey] for authenticating to S3. It is recommended to place this
setting in `$GERRIT_SITE/etc/@PLUGIN@.secure.config`.
