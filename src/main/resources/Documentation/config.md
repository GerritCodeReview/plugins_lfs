# Plugin @PLUGIN@ configuration

## Core Gerrit Settings

The following options must be set in `$GERRIT_SITE/etc/gerrit.config`.

### Section `lfs`

lfs.plugin = @PLUGIN@
: With this option set LFS requests are forwarded to the @PLUGIN@ plugin.

### Section `auth`

auth.gitBasicAuth = true
: Git LFS client uses Basic HTTP auth with LFS requests. When this option
is not enabled (not set or equals to `false`) Git LFS HTTP requests are treated
as anonymous requests. Therefore requests will be successfully authorized only
for projects that allows anonymous to perform requested operation.

## Per Project Settings

The following options can be configured in `@PLUGIN@.config` on the
`refs/meta/config` branch of the `All-Projects` project.

```
  [@PLUGIN@ "sandbox/*"]
    enabled = true
    maxObjectSize = 10m
  [@PLUGIN@ "public/*"]
    enabled = true
    maxObjectSize = 200m
  [@PLUGIN@ "customerX/*"]
    enabled = true
    maxObjectSize = 500m
  [@PLUGIN@ "customerY/*"]
    enabled = false
```

A namespace can be specified as

- exact project name (`plugins/myPlugin`): Defines LFS settings for one project.

- pattern (`sandbox/*`): Defines LFS settings for one project namespace.

- regular expression (`^test-.*/.*`): Defines LFS settings for the namespace
matching the regular expression.

- for-each-pattern (`?/*`): Defines the same LFS settings for each subfolder.
`?` is a placeholder for any name and `?/*` with `maxObjectSize = 100m` means
that for every subfolder the maximum object size is `100 mb`. Hence `?/*` is a
shortcut for having n explicit namespaces.

If a project name matches several @PLUGIN@ namespaces, the one the that is defined
first in the @PLUGIN@.config will be applied.

Example: Enable LFS for all projects, allowing unlimited object size for
projects under `/test` and limiting to `500 mb` for projects under other
folders:

```
  [@PLUGIN@ "test/*]
    enabled = true
  [@PLUGIN@ "?/*"]
    enabled = true
    maxObjectSize = 500m
```

Example: Only enable LFS for projects under `customer-A`:

```
  [@PLUGIN@ "customer-A/*]
    enabled = true
```


### Section `lfs`

lfs.enabled
: Whether to enable LFS for projects in this namespace. If not set, defaults
to `false`.

lfs.maxObjectSize
: Maximum allowed object size (per object) in bytes for projects in this
namespace, or 0 for no limit. If not set, defaults to 0. Common unit suffixes
of `k`, `m`, and `g` are supported.

lfs.readOnly
: Whether to switch LFS for projects in this namespace into read-only mode.
In this mode reading LFS objects is still possible but pushing is forbidden.
Note that regular git operations are not affected.
If not set, defaults to `false`.

lfs.backend
: Backend that should be used for storing binaries. It has to be one of
backends specified as [fs](#lfs-fs-backend) or [s3](#lfs-s3-backend) subsection
of Global Plugin Settings. If not set, defaults to value of `storage.backend`
from Global Plugin Settings.

## Global Plugin Settings

The following options can be configured in `$GERRIT_SITE/etc/@PLUGIN@.config`
and `$GERRIT_SITE/etc/@PLUGIN@.secure.config.`

### Section `auth`

auth.sshExpirationSeconds
: Validity, in seconds, of authentication token for SSH requests.
[Git LFS Authentication](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/docs/api/authentication.md)
specifies that SSH might be used to authenticate the user. Successful authentication
provides token that is later used for Git LFS requests.
: Default is `10` seconds.

### Section `storage`

storage.backend
: The default storage backend to use. Valid values are `fs` for local file system,
and `s3` for Amazon S3. If not set, defaults to `fs`.

### <a id="lfs-fs-backend"></a>Section `fs` - default file system backend

The following configuration options are only used when the backend is `fs`.

fs.directory
: The directory in which to store data files. If not specified, defaults to
the plugin's data folder: `$GERRIT_SITE/data/@PLUGIN@`.

fs.expirationSeconds
: Validity, in seconds, of authentication token for signed requests.
Gerrit's LFS protocol handler signs requests to be issued by the git-lfs
extension. This way the git-lfs extension doesn't need any credentials to
access objects in the FS bucket. Validity of these request signatures expires
after this period.
: Default is `10` seconds.

### <a id="lfs-s3-backend"></a>Section `s3` - default S3 backend

The following configuration options are only used when the backend is `s3`.

s3.region
: [Amazon region](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions)
the S3 storage bucket is residing in.

s3.bucket
: Name of the [Amazon S3 storage bucket](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/UG/CreatingaBucket.html)
 which will store large objects.

s3.storageClass
: [Amazon S3 storage class](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html)
 used for storing large objects.
: Default is `REDUCED_REDUNDANCY`

s3.expirationSeconds
: Expiration in seconds of validity of signed requests. Gerrit's LFS protocol
handler signs requests to be issued by the git-lfs extension with the configured
`accessKey` and `secretKey`. This way the git-lfs extension doesn't need
any credentials to access objects in the S3 bucket. Validity of these request
signatures expires after this period.
: Default is `60` seconds.

s3.disableSslVerify
: `true`: SSL verification is disabled
: `false`: SSL verification is enabled
: Default is `false`.

s3.accessKey
: The [Amazon IAM accessKey](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html)
for authenticating to S3. It is recommended to place this
setting in `$GERRIT_SITE/etc/@PLUGIN@.secure.config`.

s3.secretKey
: The [Amazon IAM secretKey](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html)
 for authenticating to S3. It is recommended to place this
setting in `$GERRIT_SITE/etc/@PLUGIN@.secure.config`.

### Multiple LFS backends

One can specify multiple LFS backends for both FS and S3 storage by introducing
backend subsections:

```
  [fs "foo"]
    directory = /foo_dir
  [s3 "bar"]
    ...
```

and use them for namespace configuration by adding backend namespace parameter:

```
  [@PLUGIN@ "sandbox/*"]
    backend = foo
    ...
  [@PLUGIN@ "release/*"]
    backend = bar
    ...
```

## Local Project Configuration

The following options must be set in the local project's `.git/config` file.

### Section `lfs`

lfs.url
: `http://<username>@<gerrit-host>:<port>/<project-name>/info/lfs`

When the Gerrit repo is cloned via ssh, the git lfs url must be set to use http.
