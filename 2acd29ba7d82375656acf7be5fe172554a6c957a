I have not tested the plugin in Gerrit server.\n\nThere is one remaining issue to include the jgit-lfs sources from jgit submodule in Eclipse. Currently, only packages are included that actually needed by Gerrit core. This could be probably extended to jgit-lfs packages as well in follow-up change in gerrit core, in tools/eclipse/project.py?",
