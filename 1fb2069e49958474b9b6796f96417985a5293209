      "message": "This one should pass with stable-3.9  , then for stable-3.10 / master we need to fix PluginCommandModule which is https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/plugins/lfs/+/430179/\n\nIt is a bit of a chicken and egg problem, I am not sure how to have them merged with CI passing.  Maybe merge this one in a stable-3.9,  cut a stable-3.10 out of it and then move the other change 430179 to stable-3.10 (which will pass).",
