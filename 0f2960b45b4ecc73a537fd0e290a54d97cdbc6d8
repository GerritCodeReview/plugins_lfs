The lfs.maxObjectSize is one such critical parameter. Increasing it over a globally set limit should be done by an admin.",

It must be possible to increase the maxObjectSize over the inherited maxObjectSize for a single project.\n* project owners should be able to change lfs.maxObjectSize for their project (Notice the \"should\" instead of \"must\").\n* assuming project owners are allowed to set lfs.maxObjectSize for their project(s), admins must be able to set an upper limit for lfs.maxObjectSize which project owners cannot exceed\n\nDo you agree?",
