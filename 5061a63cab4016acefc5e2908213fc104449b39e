We have two options:\n\n* we create stable-3.2, upload this change to stable-3.2 and then merge up to master and adapt this line in merge commit\n* we merged this change to master, create stable-3.2 branch after this change was merged, and adapt this line on stable-3.2 branch.\n\nI would defer to maintainers of this plugin for solution how to proceed here.",
