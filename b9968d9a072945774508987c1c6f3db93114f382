      "message": "not really, SSH call to generate token provides also the username as there is no other way to pass username between calls (see [1]).\nApart from that I am not sure why one would need to have these parameters. I am not sure the intention here: do you want to have Token that is built from parameters and results in value (which is ciphered string built out of params) and as a second option created out of ciphered text (parameters would be read upon successful de-cipher)?\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/94912/",
